BIG-IQ Solo Use Cases 
=====================

Welcome
-------

Welcome to the **F5 BIG-IQ Solo Use Cases Lab**.

This lab provides hands-on experience using F5's BIG-IQ focused on specific use cases. Each section can be completed
without needing to have completed a previous section, so feel free to jump around!

**What is BIG-IQ**

BIG-IQ allows you to take an **application-centric** approach to core IT, networking, services provisioning, 
and deployment with a unified tool for gaining visibility into and managing your F5 application delivery and security portfolio.

BIG-IQ significantly extends the operability and value of your F5 investment. From a single console, 
BIG-IQ offers users the ability to create, configure, deploy, analyze, troubleshoot, patch, and upgrade 
F5 **security** and **application delivery services**. BIG-IQ also supports holistic device management of 
F5 BIG-IP™ **physical and virtual devices** both locally and in the cloud.

From per-app virtual editions to traditional hardware appliances, BIG-IQ makes it possible to gain visibility 
into apps and devices, leverage **automated workflows**, simplify configuration, and ensure every team—and every 
app—has the resources required to perform optimally. 

With BIG-IQ you can quickly and easily manage, analyze, and troubleshoot every device, every application, and 
every policy from one **centralized** location—no matter the operating environment.
