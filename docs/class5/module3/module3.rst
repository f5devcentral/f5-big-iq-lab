Module 3: Automate device backups and archiving
===============================================

BIG-IQ provides the ability to backup individual or groups of managed devices on an ad-hoc or a scheduled basis.
The admin can decide how long to retain the backups on BIG-IQ and has the option of archiving a copy
of the UCS backup off to an external device for DR or deeper storage purposes.
