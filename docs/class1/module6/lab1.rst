Lab 6.1: Importing AS3 templates
--------------------------------

Official documentation about AS3 via a GUI can be found: https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-big-iq

From UDF, launch a Console/RDP session to have access to the Ubuntu Desktop. Go to Ubuntu Jumphost and select Details > XRDP and select the resolution of choice. (Tip: modern laptops with higher resolutions you might want to use 1440x900 and once XRDP is launched Zoom to 200%)

#. Make yourself familiar with the Github page and understand which AS3 templates are available.

#. When the AS3 templates are already imported in BIG-IQ you don’t need to perform step 5, instead continue with step 6.

#. Use the provided instructions on the Github page to import the templates into BIG-IQ.

#. Walk through the provided templates and select them to understand the structure. If familiar with AS3 you will notice the structure. 
   Otherwise go make sure you have gone through `Module 5`_ or visit `AS3 Example declarations`_.
